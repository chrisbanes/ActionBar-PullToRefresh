# ActionBar-PullToRefresh

![ActionBar-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/raw/master/header.png)

ActionBar-PullToRefresh provides an easy way to add a modern version of the pull-to-refresh interaction to your application.

Please note that this is __not__ an update to [Android-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh), this has been created from new. You should think of this as Android-PullToRefresh's younger, leaner cousin.

### This is a Preview
Please note that this is currently in a preview state. This basically means that the API is not fixed and you should expect changes between releases.

### Todo
As this is a preview also means that function is missing. See the [Todo](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/wiki/Todo) page for more info on what needs to be added.

## Sample

Eventually the sample will be available to download on Google Play. As we're not stable yet you can find the APK [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxAFUoBj0OjaYTd3SUkzYjIydG8&usp=sharing).

## Supported Views

ActionBar-PullToRefresh has in-built support for:

 * AbsListView derivatives (ListView & GridView).
 * ScrollView
 * WebView

If the View you want to use is not listed above, you can easily add support by providing a `Delegate`. See the 'Delegates' section below for more info.

---

## Usage
You just need to create an instance of `PullToRefreshAttacher`, giving it the Activity and the View for which will scroll.

``` java
private PullToRefreshAttacher mPullToRefreshHelper;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        
    // Get View for which the user will scrollâ€¦
    View scrollableView = findViewById(R.id.blah); 

    mPullToRefreshHelper = new PullToRefreshAttacher(this, scrollableView);
    mPullToRefreshHelper.setRefreshListener(this);
}
```

__See the [ListView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/blob/master/samples/stock/src/uk/co/senab/actionbarpulltorefresh/samples/stock/ListViewActivity.java) sample for more info.__
