# ActionBar-PullToRefresh

![ActionBar-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/raw/master/header.png)

ActionBar-PullToRefresh provides an easy way to add a modern version of the pull-to-refresh interaction to your application.

Please note that this is __not__ an update to [Android-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh), this has been created from new. You should think of this as Android-PullToRefresh's younger, leaner cousin.

### This is a Preview
Please note that this is currently in a preview state. This basically means that the API is not fixed and you should expect changes between releases.

## Sample Apps

There are two sample applications, the stock sample which uses the standard library and is therefore has a `minSdkVersion` of 14. There is also a sample which uses the ActionBarSherlock extra so has a `minSdkVersion` of 7.

## Supported Views

ActionBar-PullToRefresh has in-built support for:

 * AbsListView derivatives (ListView & GridView).
 * ScrollView
 * WebView

If the View you want to use is not listed above, you can easily add support in your own code by providing a `ViewDelegate`. See the `ViewDelegate` section below for more info.
